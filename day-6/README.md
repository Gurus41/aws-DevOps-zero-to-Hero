# Route53

Route 53's simple routing is one of the basic routing policies offered by the service. It's straightforward and easy to set up, making it suitable for scenarios where you want to route traffic to a single resource, such as a web server or an S3 bucket.

Here's how simple routing works:

Single Resource: With simple routing, you associate a domain name (e.g., example.com) with a single resource, such as an EC2 instance, an S3 bucket configured for static website hosting, or an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).
DNS Record: You create a DNS record (e.g., an A record) in your Route 53 hosted zone and specify the domain name and the IP address or the endpoint of the resource you want to route traffic to.
Traffic Distribution: When a user makes a DNS query for your domain name, Route 53 responds with the IP address or the endpoint you specified in the DNS record. The user's browser or application then connects directly to that resource to access the content.
No Health Checks or Failover: Simple routing does not include health checks or failover capabilities. If the resource becomes unavailable, Route 53 does not automatically reroute traffic to another resource. It's up to you to monitor the health of your resource and take appropriate action if needed.
Cost-effective: Since it's a basic routing policy, simple routing is often the most cost-effective option for scenarios where you only have one resource to route traffic to.
Simple routing is ideal for scenarios like hosting a static website on Amazon S3, where you have a single endpoint to serve content. It's easy to set up and manage, making it a good choice for smaller-scale deployments or for getting started with Route 53.
